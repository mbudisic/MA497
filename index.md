**Welcome to MA497!** So what's this class about?

MA497 is a course in which grade and credit is given for directed research with faculty. In particular, my section of MA497 is 106 (MA497-106), and other faculty may have their own sections and procedures for how to do research with them.

MA497 is not a course open to everyone - if you are interested in doing an undergraduate research with me, you will typically have a topic in mine that meshes with my own research program. A single semester is typically a too-short time to make significant progress. So you should plan on either committing to two successive semesters, or a semester+summer, but preferrably even longer.

Broadly speaking, my research is in:

* dynamical systems (theory and applications)
* applications of dynamical systems to engineering and biological phenomena
* topological data analysis
